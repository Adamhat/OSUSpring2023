For the following graphs, decide whether they are
   (1) directed or undirected, (2) dense or sparse, and (3) cyclic or acyclic:

   (a) Facebook
   1. directed
   2. dense
   3. cyclic

   (b) Twitter
   1. directed
   2. sparse
   3. cyclic

   (c) a family
   1. undirected
   2. sparse
   3. acyclic

   (d) V=airports, E=direct_flights
   1. directed
   2. sparse
   3. cyclic

   (e) a mesh
   1. undirected
   2. dense
   3. cyclic

   (f) V=courses, E=prerequisites
   1. directed
   2. sparse
   3. acyclic

   (g) a tree
   1. undirected
   2. sparse
   3. acyclic

   (h) V=linux_software_packages, E=dependencies
   1. directed
   2. sparse
   3. acyclic?

   (i) DP subproblems for 0-1 knapsack
   1. directed
   2. sparse
   3. acyclic

   Can you name a very big dense graph?

   Optical fiber network for internet connection


questions: 
   (a) did you realize that bottom-up implementations of DP use (implicit) topological orderings?
       e.g., what is the topological ordering in your (or my) bottom-up bounded knapsack code?
       
      I did not realize it untill I watched a video explaining the algo using a map. Watching it being broken down made it extremely 
      clear that it used (implicit) topological orderings. For the bounded knapsack, first you start with item one, preform operations 
      then move to the next item and etc.

   (b) what about top-down implementations? what order do they use to traverse the graph?

      Top down would likely begin at a node with no edges then move into each neighbor.

   (c) does that suggest there is a top-down solution for topological sort as well? 

      A believe it does.

1. Approximately how many hours did you spend on this assignment?
6+ hours
2. Would you rate it as easy, moderate, or difficult?
difficult
3. Did you work on it mostly alone, or mostly with other people?
alone
4. How deeply do you feel you understand the material it covers (0%-100%)?
~60%
5. Take a moment to reflect on your midterm performance; separate the data structures and DP parts.
   Now, do you understand all the problems you didn't solve correctly?
Did as well as I hoped with the timeframe I had
6. Any other comments?
N/A
