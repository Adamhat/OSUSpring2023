There are two methods for building a heap from an unsorted array:
(1) insert each element into the heap  --- O(nlogn) -- heapq.heappush()
(2) heapify (top-down)                 --- O(n)     -- heapq.heapify()

Derive these time complexities.
O(nlogn) and O(n)

Q: What are the time complexities of these algorithms? 
O(n^2 logn^2) , O(n^2) , O(nlogn)

Q: What's the time complexity? Are you sure it's the optimal?
    Hint: you can improve it a little bit, since most states don't have any one on Team USA!
    No need to implement this improvement though.

O(nlogn)
